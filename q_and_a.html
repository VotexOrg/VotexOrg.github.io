Q & A
</p><p>
What other work has been done in voting systems?
</p><p>
In the past decade, a number of academic voting procedures have tended to focus on cryptography.
</p><p>
These procedures use elaborate hashing functions to obscure the receipt code and the posted vote codes. Voters can see that their ballots were recorded, but they cannot directly verify their individual vote.
</p><p>
Why does VOTE{X} not use ballot code cryptography* ?
</p><p>
The rationale for cryptographic procedures is to prevent vote buying. The argument goes that if voters can prove how they voted, they can sell their vote. But no technology can ever stop vote buying between a determined buyer and seller. Voters can always secretly videotape themselves completing the ballot, proving their vote without any official documentation.
</p><p>
Vote buying seems to be rare in America at present. It was a problem in the nineteenth century until 1892, when voting by secret ballot (prohibiting oral roll calls) became universal among U.S. states. It was diminished further in 1925 when criminal statutes against paying people to vote were instituted. Since the 1940s, there have been no examples of widespread vote buying in the U.S. We should still appreciate the potential for the problem to emerge. But the remedy must come from law enforcement and cultural norms, not technology.
</p><p>
Even if cryptography somehow solved vote-buying, there's still a tradeoff with verifiability. By definition, cryptographic methods cannot be fully verifiable. If you can't prove how you voted to someone else, how can you prove it to yourself?
</p><p>
(*) To clarify, VOTE{X} does not employ cryptography to obfuscate the link between the ballot code and the receipt code. It does encrypt the channel between the scanner and the vote processing server to reduce the likelihood of intercepted ballot codes.
</p><p>
What about secrecy?
</p><p>
Secrecy is sacred. VOTE{X} maintains ballot secrecy as long as the "shuffle" step of the process is done in good faith. (Of course, any other voting method involving malicious administrators would be vulnerable, too.)
</p><p>
What about voting on the blockchain?
</p><p>
To quote Randall Munroe:
</p><p>
(relevant xkcd)How can I support this initiative?
</p><p>
You can try the Vote{X} system and give us feedback. (It's free, fun, and may help your group make better decisions.)
</p><p>
You can advocate for the adoption of alternative voting methods in your state and local elections.
</p><p>
You can contribute to our open-source code repository.

Quoting Washington again, this time in agreement…
</p><p>
In a republic, what species of knowledge can be equally important … than the science of government? And what duty more pressing than communicating it to those who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country?
