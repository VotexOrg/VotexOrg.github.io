<p>The administrator (or committee of administrators) compiles a voter roll.</p>
<p>
  <hr><li></p>
<p>(a) The administrator uses an offline computer to generate a pair of unique random codes for each voter, a ballot code and an ownership code.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ballot code certifies that the ballot is authentic.
<li>The ownership code can be used to prove ownership of a ballot code if a ballot is maliciously intercepted before it is recorded.
</ul>
<p>(b) The administrator prints out the list of valid code pairs and archives the papers in a secure lockbox, to be opened after the voting deadline.</p>
<p><hr><li></p>
<p>(a) The administrator prints out ballots, with a unique ballot code printed on the bottom of each page.</p>
<p>(b) For each ballot, administrators print a unique code page containing the corresponding ballot code and ownership code.</p>
<p><hr><li></p>
<p>The ballot-generating computer is placed in an offline safe for auditing if necessary.</p>
<p><hr><li></p>
<p>a. The ballots and coded instruction pages are paired and placed in sealed envelopes.</p>
<p>b. The envelopes are shuffled to ensure secrecy.
<p>c. The envelopes are distributed, either by mail or in person at polling stations.</p>
<p><hr><li></p>
<p>a. Voters fill out the enclosed ballot. Or, voters can create and print out their own ballots using with ballot code.</p>
<p>b. Voters return the ballots by mail or in person.
<p>c. Voters retain their code page if they want to confirm their vote later.
<p><hr><li></p>
<p>a. Ballots are scanned, either at a central scanning facility or at many polling stations.
<p>Note: Scanning hardware can be "dumb", just taking scans and sending images to a server using Syncthing. (This allows the use of low-cost off-the-shelf scanners.)
<p>b. Scanning may be performed at a central facility or at many distributed facilities in parallel. In either case, the ballots should be archived for audit.
<p><hr><li></p>
<p>a. After the voting deadline, the administrators open the locked vault and scan the pages of ballot codes. The scanned images are interpreted as codes and entered into a database.
<p>b. The scanned votes are then decrypted, filtered, interpreted, tallied, and published.
<p>c. Each published vote is indexed starting at 1 and includes a running total of the score. For conventional voting and score voting, the cumulative score after vote (n) is a function of vote (n) and the cumulative score after vote (n-1). This allows a decentralized audit to confirm the tally.
<p><hr><li></p>
<p>Voters can enter their ballot code online and receive the corresponding public vote index. This allows voters to verify that their vote was recorded as cast.
<p><hr><li></p>
<p>The administrator certifies the result.
